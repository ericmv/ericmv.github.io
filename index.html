            Hi, I'm Eric, a recent graduate of UCI with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
            My experiences range from voluntary back-end web scripting for UCI Circle K,
            to professional software development and engineering both at UCI Applied Innovation and Lantronix.

            <br><br>
            Throughout my experiences in back-end development, front-end development, and embedded systems,
            I've discovered an inclination toward full-stack web development.
            My expertise includes languages like Python, C++, Javascript and HTML, with environments and
            frameworks like React, Node, Linux, Express, and more.
            <br><br>
            I am currently seeking full-time employment
            in a software engineering role. I have 2+ years of professional software engineering experience and
            3+ years of personal projects in web and application development. If you are a recruiter or are interested
            in talking more about my experiences, I'd love to have a chat!

              <p><strong>Irvine, CA</strong></p>
              <p>
              I am working on creating an amazing demo showcase of our newest software, <a href="https://www.lantronix.com/products/mach10/" target="_blank">MACH10</a>, using Python and C++. This internship is where I got to really apply everything I learned in school
              to a real application. It's also one where I've had the chance to work with people who I never thought I'd be working with here. From the CTO, to VP of Engineering to Senior Product
              Line Managers and Marketing Managers, the demo has come a long way with the collaborative effort of everyone I've worked with.

              <p><strong>Irvine, CA</strong></p>
              <p>
              I'm glad to have had the privilege of studying at UC Irvine. These past 4 years is where I learned more than I ever have, not only about computer science and what I studied, but
              also about myself and life in general. I've made a great network, joined organizations, took on leadership opportunities and found what I am passionate about. UCI has given me many
              opportunities and being here taught me to take on every opportunity and really pursue the things I'm passionate about, career-related or not. I'm happy with where I am now, thanks to
              the support and knowledge I've acquired in college.

              <p><strong>Irvine, CA</strong></p>
              <p>
              My co-workers and I were given a lot of creative freedom to develop internal tools for
              <a href="http://innovation.uci.edu/the-cove/" target="_blank">The Cove</a>. We automated content display, created a custom events site for clients to book our event space, and created an internal search database.
              Arguably the biggest project we worked on was creating the Slackbot for The Cove, which uses
              <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> API to read message commands and automate tasks such as rebooting computers, creating tickets, and changing content. Working here was one of the first times where I saw
              my work come to life in a professional setting and help others. These projects encouraged me to develop with a purpose and develop for the greater good of those around me.

              <p><strong>Irvine, CA</strong></p>
              <p>
              One of the best things about UCI is being able to choose from over 500 different organizations to join. <a href="http://www.ucicirclek.com/main/" target="_blank">UCI Circle K</a> is one of the reasons I am where I am today. It's helped me more than
              many jobs ever could. It's here where I grew the most in college, gaining confidence, growing a network, taking on leadership roles and working with a team. As Secretary I had the privilege
              of working with a team of Executive and Appointed board members to create events and projects for over 400 members. Here was also the first time where I applied what I learned in school
              to develop something for others to use. It pushed me to pursue internship and other career opportunities where I would be able to create something to make people's lives easier.

              UCI CER was my first job as a college student. While non-technical, it taught me a lot about professionalism and the workplace. It gave me an introduction to meetings, working in the
              office, attention to detail, and collaboration. I'm thankful for my supervisor, Jeri, for guiding me and encouraging me to pursue new opportunities.

                the device to the caretaker. Created for 2016 Autism App Jam.
